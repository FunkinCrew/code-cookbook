# Scripted Song Events

This chapter will walk you through the process of creating a custom song event, which could be used in songs through the chart editor.

Start by creating a scripted class file with the `.hxc` extension (in the `mods/mymod/scripts/events` if you want to keep things organized)

```haxe
// Remember to import each class you want to reference in your script!
import funkin.play.event.SongEvent;

// Choose a name for your scripted class that will be unique, and make sure to specifically extend the SongEvent class.
class FocusCameraSongEvent extends SongEvent {
    public function new() {
        // The constructor gets called once, when the game loads.
        // The constructor takes one parameter, which is the event ID for your custom event.
        super('FocusCamera');
    }

    // Add override functions here!
}
```

You can then add override functions to perform custom behavior.

## Performing behavior when getting called

To provide custom behavior to the event that gets called when the song reaches the event's position, you must override the function `handleEvent`. Overriding this function is mandatory, as if your custom event doesn't include it, the game will crash when attempting to activate the event. The function comes with a parameter from which you can retreive some information about the event, such as the property values provided. An example of this can be found in the event Play Animation[^playanim]

```haxe
// ...

// Line 18
public override function handleEvent(data:SongEventData)
{
    // Does nothing if there is no PlayState camera or stage.
    if (PlayState.instance == null || PlayState.instance.currentStage == null) return;

    var targetName = data.getString('target');
    var anim = data.getString('anim');
    var force = data.getBool('force');
    if (force == null) force = false;

    // ...
}

// ...

```

## Providing song event properties

The game supports providing events some additional properties for more leeway in functionality. For this, you need to override the function `getEventSchema` that returns an array of anonymous objects, each representing a property your event can have. The structure of these anonymous objects is as follows:

- `name`: The internal name of the property, which you can use to get the value of the property when executing the event.

- `title`: The visible name of the property, as displayed in the chart editor events toolbox.

- `type`: The type of the event. Can be either `string` (text properties), `integer`, `float`, `bool` or `enum` (dropdown properties).

- `defaultValue`: An optional default value for the property.

- `keys`: Is an optional map with keys representing the visible name and values representing the internal name of the property values.
  - Accessible to the `enum `properties.

- `min`: Represents the optional minimum value that the property could have.
  - Available to the `integer` and `float` properties.

- `max`: Represents the optional maximum value that the property could have.
  - Available to the `integer` and `float` properties.

- `step`: Represents the amount the value steps by for each change in the toolbox. This field is optional and defaults to `0.1`.
  - Available to the `integer` and `float` properties.

- `units`: Represents the unit of measure for the numeric value. (i.e. pixels, steps etc.)
  - Available to the `integer` and `float` properties.

## Custom song event chart editor icon

Chart editor supports both static and animated song event icons in the spritesheet format. To provide a custom icon for your event in the chart editor, you need to put two things in the `mods/mymod/images/ui/chart-editor/events` folder:

- An image of your song event icon named after what you put in the event's constructor.

- An XML file for your song event icon, even if it's a single frame.
  - The frame names must start with the text you put inside the event's constructor.

Once you made sure both assets are where they should be and have the correct names, your song event should have a custom icon in the chart editor.

## Custom song event title

To give your song event an unique title that will be displayed in the chart editor's event toolbox dropdown, you must override the function `getTitle` with the return of your desired event title. An example of this is found in the event Zoom Camera[^camzoom]

```haxe
// ...

// Line 91
public override function getTitle():String
{
    return 'Zoom Camera';
}

// ...
```
