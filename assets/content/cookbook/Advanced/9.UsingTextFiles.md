# Text Files

While not used much by Friday Night Funkin' (in exception to `introText.txt`), the ability to read and save to text files may be useful for some mods. 

## Reading a .txt file

To read a text file, you will not need any imports, by default `funkin.Paths` is imported into scripts, which is what we need to access text files.

The text file must exist to be read and have content in it to be read by the game. The text file will be read from the `data` folder of your mod.

Below is an example of how to read a text file.

```haxe
import funkin.modding.module.Module;

class Tutorial extends Module {
    var data:String = ''; // This variable will contain the text when we read the text file.
    public function new() 
    {
        super("Tutorial");
    }
    
    override public function onCreate():Void // This will be called once upon the game starting.
    { 
        super.onCreate();
        data = Assets.getText(Paths.txt("Player")); // Txt file, ALWAYS in "data" folder.
        trace('text contents are ' + data); // Prints contents of text file in the console.
    }
}
```

## Saving to a .txt file

Unlike reading a text file, some more things will need to be imported to correctly save a text file. More specifically you will need to import the following:
"-`funkin.util.FileUtil`"

This is needed to save text files. Like reading a text file, the text files MUST be in your `data` folder in your mod, and must already exist before attempting to save to it (the game will NOT create a text file if it does not already exist).

Below is an example of how to save a text file.

```haxe
import funkin.util.FileUtil; // Required module to save text files
import funkin.modding.module.Module;
class Tutorial extends Module {
    public function new() 
    {
        super("Tutorial");
    }
    
    override public function onCreate():Void // This will be called upon the game starting
    {
        super.onCreate();
        FileUtil.writeStringToPath(Assets.getPath(Paths.txt("Player")), 'extra large potato'); 
        // Above will save to our mod's data folder to the text file named "Player.txt" and will write "extra large potato" in said text file
    }
}
```
