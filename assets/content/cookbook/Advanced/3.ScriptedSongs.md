# Scripted Songs

This chapter will walk you through the process of adding a script to a Song, and giving examples of the kind of custom behavior which can be implemented with this functionality.

Start by creating a scripted class file with the `.hxc` extension (in the `mods/mymod/scripts/songs` if you want to keep things organized).

```haxe
// Remember to import each class you want to reference in your script!
import funkin.play.song.Song;

// Choose a name for your scripted class that will be unique, and make sure to specifically extend the Song class.
// This class's functions will override the default behavior for the song.
class BallisticSong extends Song {
	public function new() {
        // The constructor gets called once, when the game loads.
        // The constructor takes one parameter, which is the song ID for the song you are applying the script to.
		super('ballistic');
	}

    // Add override functions here!
}
```

You can then add override functions to perform custom behavior.

## Custom 'NEW'-Label criteria

Usually, in the Freeplay menu, a song would not have the glowing 'NEW' label. However if you override the function `isSongNew`, you can have the label appear if a specific criteria is met. An example of this is found in the script for Cocoa[^cocoa] which returns true if the variation is Pico and the player hasn't beaten Cocoa Pico Mix.
```haxe
// ...

// Line 29
public override function isSongNew(currentDifficulty:String, currentVariation:String):Bool
{
    if (currentVariation == 'pico') return !Save.instance.hasBeatenSong(this.id, null, 'pico');

    return false;
}

// ...
```

## Custom Alternate Instrumental behavior

Instead of reading from the song's metadata file for possible alternate instrumentals, you can use scripts to lock some of them out of being used until a criteria is met. An example of this is found in the script for Stress[^stress] which locks the pico instrumental behind completing the pico remix, as well as not provide the default instrumental if the song is selected on the pico variation.
```haxe
// ...

// Line 42
public override function listAltInstrumentalIds(difficultyId:String, variationId:String):Array<String>
{
    if (difficultyId == 'easy' || difficultyId == 'normal' || difficultyId == 'hard')
    {
        var hasBeatenPicoMix = Save.instance.hasBeatenSong(this.id, null, 'pico');

        switch (variationId)
        {
            case 'pico':
                // return hasBeatenPicoMix ? [''] : [];
                // No Pico mix on BF instrumental, sorry!
                return [];
            default:
                return hasBeatenPicoMix ? ['pico'] : [];
        }
    }

    return [];
}

// ...
```

## Hiding the Song from the Freeplay Menu

The most important thing to override here is the function `listDifficulties`. If you return an empty array, the song will be omitted from the Freeplay menu. An example to this is in the song 2hot[^2hot]
```haxe
// ...
        
// Line 51
public function listDifficulties(variationId:String, variationIds:Array<String>, showLocked:Bool):Array<String>
{
    if (showLocked || Save.instance.hasBeatenLevel('weekend1'))
    {
        return super.listDifficulties(variationId, variationIds);
    }

    // Hide all difficulties if the player has not beaten the week.
    return [];
}

// ...
```
