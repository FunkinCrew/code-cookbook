# Scripted Modules

Most articles about scripting will cover basic functionality of overriding already existing methods. However, there is a need for completely custom functionality instead. This is where Modules step in.

A module is a class which runs very similarly to global scripts in other game engines. They are basically mini-states that run parallel to the original state.

## Creating a Module

```haxe
import funkin.modding.module.Module;

class KE_QOL extends Module
{
    public function new()
    {
        // This registers a NAME for the module, which might be needed later!
        super("KE-QOL");
    }

    public override function onScriptEvent(event:ScriptEvent)
    {
        // ...
    }

    public override function onStateChangeBegin(event:StateChangeScriptEvent)
    {
        // ...
    }

    public override function onNoteIncoming(event:NoteScriptEvent)
    {
        // ...
    }

    public override function onSongStart(event:ScriptEvent)
    {
        // ...
    }

    public override function onSongLoaded(event:SongLoadScriptEvent)
    {
        // ...
    }
}
```

Modules have all the events most scripts have, but the difference is. You also have access to state change events, every script event, losing/gaining focus, and sub-state changes.

Modules also have a priority system for compatibility with other mods, in your construction method, `new()`, you can set the `priority` property (which defaults to `1000`). 1 is processed before anything else.

You can view a detailed list of script events and their callbacks in [here](../Advanced/6.ScriptEventCallbacks.md)
