# Miscellaneous Coding Tricks

This article will cover a handful of miscellaneous coding tricks that you could do in the game, largely thanks to the framework Funkin' was built on - HaxeFlixel. 

Most of these are recommeded to be used with [Modules](01.ScriptedModules.md), so it is recommended that you familiarize yourself with them beforehand.

## Activating something only on game launch

As of 0.8.0, the `onCreate` function on Modules gets dispatched on hot-reloading, alongside getting dispatched after everything in the game was initialized. This could potentially break a couple of things that the programmer wanted to only be activated once, on game launch. Luckily, Flixel provides a signal for this - `FlxG.signals.postGameStart`, which gets dispatched after everything in the game's initialization state gets created. 

You could use it as follows:

```haxe
import flixel.FlxG;
import funkin.modding.module.Module;

// ...

class IntroModule extends Module
{
    var isInIntro:Bool = false;

    public override function new()
    {
        super("IntroModule", 0);

        // add a signal that only gets dispatched in the once in a play session
        FlxG.signals.postGameStart.addOnce(function()
        {
            isInIntro = true;
        });
    }

    public override function onCreate(event:ScriptEvent)
    {
        if (isInIntro)
        {
            // add some code here
        }
    }
}

```
